*Advised by Yuyu Lin and Alexandra Ion from the <a href = "https://interactive-structures.org/">Interactive Structures Lab</a>*

The DigiBrace pipeline allows users to automatically measure the finger dimnensions, hyperflexion angle, and passive & active force of a finger affected with rheumatoid arthritis. These values are then used to calculate new parameters for a new orthosis device and generate a corresponding .stl file that can be 3D printed. DigiBrace increases accessibility and efficiency for patients, hopefully making treatment more seamless and personalized. <br/> <br/>
